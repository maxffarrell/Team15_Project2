                <div>&starf</div>
                    <p>I recently purchased a new set of non-stick cookware, 
                        and I am beyond thrilled with the results! The pans 
                        heat up quickly and evenly, making cooking a breeze. 
                        The best part? Cleaning is a cinch â€“ nothing sticks! 
                        Highly recommend for anyone looking to upgrade their kitchen arsenal.</p>
