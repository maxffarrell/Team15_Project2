            <h2>Review 1 Sarah</h2>
                <div>&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;&star;</div>
                    <p>I recently purchased a new set of non-stick cookware, 
                        and I am beyond thrilled with the results! The pans 
                        heat up quickly and evenly, making cooking a breeze. 
                        The best part? Cleaning is a cinch – nothing sticks! 
                        Highly recommend for anyone looking to upgrade their kitchen arsenal.</p>

            <h2>Review 2 Mark</h2>
              <div>&starf;&starf;&starf;&star;&star;</div>
                <p>As an amateur chef, finding quality knives is crucial. 
                    I stumbled upon this knife set, and I'm in love! 
                    The blades are sharp, the handles are comfortable, 
                    and they've made prepping ingredients so much smoother. 
                    A must-have for anyone serious about their cooking game.</p>

            <h2>Review 4 Alex</h2>
              <div>&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;&star;</div>
                <p>Investing in a high-quality blender was the best decision 
                    I made for my morning smoothies. This blender crushes ice
                    effortlessly, leaving me with smooth, creamy drinks every time. 
                    It's sturdy, easy to clean, and the multiple speed settings provide
                    versatility for various recipes. Thumbs up!</p>

            <h2>Review 5 Carlos</h2>
              <div>&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;&star;</div>
                <p>I've tried many coffee makers over the years, but this one takes the crown. 
                    The programmable features allow me to wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee,
                    and the thermal carafe keeps it hot for hours. Elegant design, user-friendly, 
                    and the coffee quality is unmatched.</p>

            <h2>Review 6 Lisa</h2>
              <div>&starf;&starf;&star;&star;&star;</div>
                <p>I was skeptical about air fryers, but after using one for a month, 
                    they're terrible! Crispy fries, juicy chicken – all bad 
                    It's a healthier alternative to deep frying but the cooking time is  slow 
                    The easy cleanup is a cherry on top however. Still a kitchen must-have!</p>
